# Remember Desktops

On some Linux desktop managers, Visual Studio Code editors don't remember their last desktop. This extension uses `wmctrl` to save the desktop of each open editor window, and restore them when the editor starts.

## Usage

There are command palette entries to save, restore, and forget the editor locations - but by default the extension will start working automatically when it is installed.
