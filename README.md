# Remember Desktops

On some Linux desktop managers, editors don't remember their last desktop. This extension uses `wmctrl` to save the desktop of each open editor window, and restore them when the editor starts.

## Usage

There are commands to save the editor locations, and to restore them, but by default the extension will start working automatically when the extension is installed.
