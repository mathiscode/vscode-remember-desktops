# Remember Desktops

[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mathiscode.remember-desktops](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mathiscode.remember-desktops)

This extension saves the associated desktop of each open editor window, and restores them when the editor starts.

On some Linux desktop managers, editors don't remember their last desktop. This extension uses `wmctrl` to save the desktop of each open editor window, and restore them when the editor starts.

## Usage

There are commands to save the editor locations, and to restore them, but by default the extension will start working automatically when the extension is installed.
